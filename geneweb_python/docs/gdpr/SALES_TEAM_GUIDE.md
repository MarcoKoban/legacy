**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Audience:** Sales Team Members

---

## Quick Reference Card

### ✅ DO's
- ✅ Explain data usage in simple terms
- ✅ Get explicit consent before collecting data
- ✅ Only collect necessary information
- ✅ Provide privacy policy link
- ✅ Document consent with date/time
- ✅ Use secure communication channels

### ❌ DON'Ts
- ❌ Pre-check consent boxes
- ❌ Assume consent from prior relationship
- ❌ Collect data "just in case"
- ❌ Share data without permission
- ❌ Make consent a condition for unrelated services
- ❌ Use confusing language

---

## 1. Introduction

As a sales team member, you're often the first point of contact for potential customers. This means you're responsible for setting the right tone for data protection and building trust. **Getting consent right from the start is crucial** - it's much harder to fix later!

**Why this matters:**
- 💶 GDPR fines can reach €20 million or 4% of global revenue
- 📉 Poor privacy practices damage reputation and trust
- ⚖️ You could be personally liable for willful violations
- ✅ Doing it right builds customer confidence

---

## 2. Understanding Consent

### 2.1 What is Valid Consent?

Under GDPR Article 7, consent must be:

1. **Freely given** - Not bundled with other terms, not forced
2. **Specific** - Clear what they're consenting to
3. **Informed** - Know who, what, why, how data is used
4. **Unambiguous** - Clear affirmative action required

### 2.2 What DOESN'T Count as Consent?

❌ **Pre-ticked boxes** - Passive consent is invalid  
❌ **Silence** - Not responding doesn't mean yes  
❌ **Inactivity** - Continued use of service doesn't equal consent  
❌ **Bundled consent** - Can't tie consent to service unless truly necessary  

**Example - WRONG:**
> "By continuing to browse our website, you consent to data collection."

**Example - RIGHT:**
> "I agree to receive marketing emails [☐ Checkbox]"

---

## 3. Collecting Customer Information

### 3.1 Initial Contact - What to Say

**Script Template:**

> "Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] from GeneWeb. Before we get started, I want to be transparent about how we handle your information. We'll collect your email and name to provide you with information about our genealogy platform. We'll also keep a record of our conversation for quality and training purposes. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time, and you have the right to request a copy or deletion of your data. Do you have any questions about this?"

**Key points:**
- ✅ Who you are (company name)
- ✅ What data you'll collect
- ✅ Why you need it
- ✅ Their rights (opt-out, access, deletion)
- ✅ Ask if they have questions

### 3.2 Information to Collect (MINIMUM NECESSARY)

| Stage | Required Data | Optional Data | DON'T Collect |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Initial Interest** | Name, Email | Phone number | Home address, date of birth |
| **Product Demo** | Company/family name | Preferred language | Financial details |
| **Purchase** | Billing email | Billing address (if invoicing) | Credit card details (use processor) |

**Remember:** Only collect what you actually need for your purpose!

### 3.3 Documenting Consent

**Every time you collect consent, record:**
1. **Who** - Name and email of data subject
2. **What** - What they consented to (specific wording)
3. **When** - Date and time (exact timestamp)
4. **Where** - Channel (phone, email, web form, in-person meeting)
5. **How** - Method of consent (verbal, checkbox, signature)

**Use the Sales CRM consent tracking form:**
- Template: `templates/consent_record.xlsx`
- Submit to: privacy-records@geneweb-project.eu

## 4. Sales Scenarios & Scripts

### Scenario 1: Cold Outreach

**❌ WRONG APPROACH:**
> "I got your email from [purchased list/conference attendance/LinkedIn scraping] and wanted to reach out about GeneWeb."

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
> "I'm reaching out because [legitimate connection - e.g., you attended our webinar, you downloaded our guide]. Before I share more information, may I confirm it's OK to email you about our genealogy platform? You can unsubscribe at any time."

**Legal basis:** Soft opt-in (prior relationship) or explicit consent

---

### Scenario 2: Trade Show / Conference

**At the booth:**

**Step 1 - Collect business cards:**
> "Thanks for your interest! May I keep your card to send you more information about GeneWeb? I'll add you to our mailing list, but you can unsubscribe anytime."

**Step 2 - Document consent:**
- Write date/time on back of card
- Note: "Consented to marketing emails - [Conference Name] - [Date]"
- Enter into CRM within 24 hours

**Step 3 - Follow-up email (within 48 hours):**
```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Conference Name]!

Hi [Name],

It was great speaking with you at [Conference] on [Date]. As discussed, I wanted to follow up with more information about GeneWeb's genealogy platform.

As a reminder, you agreed to receive these emails when we met at our booth. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link below.

[Your pitch here]

Best regards,
[Your Name]

---
Unsubscribe | Manage Preferences | Privacy Policy
```

---

### Scenario 3: Demo Request Form

**Web form checklist:**

✅ **Required elements:**
- Clear heading: "Request a Demo"
- Purpose statement: "We'll use your email to schedule your demo and send related information"
- Separate checkboxes for:
  - [ ] Required: "I agree to be contacted about my demo request"
  - [ ] Optional: "I'd like to receive product updates and tips (unsubscribe anytime)"
- Link to full privacy policy
- Submit button (not pre-checked boxes)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Pre-ticked boxes
- Hidden consent in Terms & Conditions
- Overly broad consent ("all communications")
- Bundling demo access with marketing consent

**Sample form text:**
```
Name: _______________
Email: _______________
Phone (optional): _______________

☐ I agree to be contacted about my demo request (required)
☐ I'd like to receive marketing emails about GeneWeb products and updates 
  (you can unsubscribe at any time)

[Privacy Policy] | [Submit Demo Request]
```

---

### Scenario 4: Existing Customer - Renewal/Upsell

**✅ CORRECT:**
You already have a relationship and can contact them about:
- Account-related information
- Service updates
- Renewals and upgrades
- Similar products/services

**❌ INCORRECT:**
You CANNOT automatically:
- Add them to general marketing lists
- Share their data with partners
- Use their data for unrelated purposes

**Script for upsell:**
> "Hi [Name], I wanted to reach out about [relevant upgrade/feature] that might benefit your family tree project. Since you're already a customer, I thought you'd want to know about this. By the way, would you also like to receive our monthly genealogy tips newsletter? It's optional - just let me know."

**Key:** Distinguish between relationship communications (OK) and marketing (need consent)

---

## 5. Handling Data Subject Requests

### 5.1 Common Requests You Might Receive

**"Can you delete my information?"**

**Your response:**
> "Of course! I'll submit your request to our privacy team right away. You should receive confirmation within 5 business days, and your data will be deleted within 1 month. I'll send you an email with the reference number for your request. Is the email address I have on file ([email]) correct?"

**Action:**
1. Email privacy@geneweb-project.eu immediately
2. CC the requester
3. Include: Name, email, phone, date of request, type of request
4. Stop all outreach to that person immediately
5. Add to "Do Not Contact" list in CRM

**"Where did you get my information?"**

**Your response:**
> "Great question! Let me check our records. [Check CRM for source] Your information came from [specific source - conference, website form, referral, etc.] on [date]. Would you like me to send you our full privacy policy that explains how we handle data?"

**"Can I get a copy of all my data?"**

**Your response:**
> "Absolutely. I'll forward your request to our privacy team, and they'll send you an export of all your information within 48 hours. You'll receive it at [confirm email address]. Is there anything specific you're looking for?"

### 5.2 When to Escalate

**Immediately forward to DPO (dpo@geneweb-project.eu) if request involves:**
- Legal threats or mentions of lawsuits
- Complaints about data breaches or security
- Requests from minors (under 16)
- Requests from deceased persons' relatives
- Media inquiries about privacy
- Requests mentioning supervisory authorities (CNIL)

---

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: "Just one more field won't hurt"

**❌ Wrong:**
> Form collects: Name, Email, Phone, Company, Address, Date of Birth, LinkedIn profile, Twitter handle, Company size, Industry, Revenue...

**✅ Right:**
> Form collects: Name, Email, Company (if B2B)

**Why:** Data minimization principle - only collect what you need

---

### Mistake #2: "Everyone does it this way"

**❌ Wrong:**
> "I'll add everyone from the conference attendee list to our email blast. Other companies do it."

**✅ Right:**
> "I'll only email people who visited our booth and explicitly agreed to be contacted."

**Why:** No consent was given by merely attending conference

---

### Mistake #3: "It's fine, we have a privacy policy"

**❌ Wrong:**
> [Tiny text at bottom of form] "By submitting, you agree to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and Marketing Policy."

**✅ Right:**
> Clear checkboxes for each type of consent, with links to policies

**Why:** Consent must be granular and freely given

---

### Mistake #4: "I'll just look them up on social media"

**❌ Wrong:**
> Using LinkedIn/Facebook data to enrich CRM records without consent

**✅ Right:**
> Only use publicly available information for initial outreach, then get consent for further use

**Why:** GDPR applies to personal data regardless of source

## 9. Training Scenarios (Test Yourself!)

### Scenario A:
You meet someone at a conference. They give you their business card but don't explicitly say you can email them. What do you do?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Best practice:** Ask permission before leaving: "May I email you more information about GeneWeb?"

**If you forgot to ask:** Send a brief email within 48 hours:
- Remind them where you met
- Explain you'd like to follow up
- Ask if they're interested in hearing more
- Make unsubscribe easy

**Legal basis:** Soft opt-in (legitimate interest in business context) with easy opt-out

</details>

### Scenario B:
A lead fills out a demo form. Your colleague suggests adding them to the weekly newsletter list "since they're already interested." Is this OK?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** NO - this is NOT OK unless they separately consented to the newsletter.

**Why:** Consent must be specific. Requesting a demo ≠ consenting to all marketing.

**Solution:** Include a separate opt-in checkbox for the newsletter on the demo form.

</details>

### Scenario C:
You're leaving the company and want to take your customer contacts with you. Can you export them from the CRM?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** ABSOLUTELY NOT. This is:
- A data breach
- Theft of company property
- Violation of GDPR (purpose limitation)
- Potentially criminal

**Why:** Customers consented to GeneWeb processing their data, not you personally or your new company.

**Legal consequences:** Fines, termination, legal action

</details>
